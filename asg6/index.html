	<h1>Six Thinking Hats with "Visual Bank"</h1>
		<h2>White Hat</h2>
			<p>This covers facts, figures, information, asking questions, defining information needs and gaps. 
			<br>“I think we need some white hat thinking at this point ...” means “Let’s drop the 
			arguments and proposals and look at the data.”</p>
		<h3>Key Points</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The website targets digital artists and creatives, from beginners to advanced users. </li>
		<li>Core platforms covered: Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Lightroom, Animate, InDesign. </li>
		<li>Tutorials (official & user-generated), User galleries for sharing creations, Community-driven tips and niche skills</li>
	</ul>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>We discussed the basic information of the website and what it’s comprised of. This includes the different platforms that tutorials will be provided for, 
			the audience of the website, and the different features that it will create for the users. Due to all these topics and ideas, these brought up the questions of what video hosting plugins would we use,
			the moderation of the content, copyright, and categorization of all the different forms of media that would be on the website. Not only that, but we would also have to establish this as a form of social media, establishing usernames 
			and passwords, the collection of information, etc. With this discussion, I realized that it may be a bit more complicated in its format to create a user-friendly space. </p>
		<h2>Red Hat</h2>
			<p>This covers intuition, feelings and emotions. The red hat allows the thinker to put forward an intuition without any need to justify it. Usually feelings and intuition can 
			only be introduced into a discussion if they are supported by logic. The feeling may be genuine but the logic might be faulty. The thinker has full permission to put 
			forward his or her feelings on the subject at that moment. </p>
		<h3>Key Points</h3>
			<p>"This feels inspiring — a place where creativity thrives and artists don’t just consume, but contribute."
			 <br>But there’s also a feeling of complexity. So many moving parts — could it become overwhelming? Will beginners feel welcomed or intimidated?" 
			<br>Emotionally, the platform can feel like an artistic sanctuary, but clarity and approachability will be key. How do we create that welcoming “first impression”? </p>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>A big part of our discussion was to ask if it would really help or hurt beginners. With such a large website and so many different creators and users, 
					beginners can feel too scared to start or even try to learn, even though it was the whole point of the website. The website feels like a safe space for creatives to share and learn, 
					and making it feel welcoming is a big part of the concept. This can be changed with the way the website is formatted and designed. With a sleek design and neatly organized to prevent the feeling of being overwhelmed.
					This can greatly help not only beginners but all users. </p>
		<h2>Black Hat</h2>
			<p>This is the logical negative. This is the hat of judgment and caution. It’s a valuable hat and the one we use most of the time. It is not in any sense an inferior or negative 
			hat. The black hat is used to point out why a suggestion does not fit the facts, the available experience, the system in use or the policy that is being followed. The 
			black hat must always be logical. </p>
		<h3>Key Points</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Content moderation: How will you handle spam, low-quality uploads, or copyright violations? </li>
		<li>Overwhelm factor: Too many tutorials or unclear organization could discourage users. </li>
		<li>Technical strain: Image and video hosting could be expensive and slow if not optimized. </li>
		<li>Competition: Platforms like YouTube, Behance, Skillshare, etc., already offer some of this. What makes Visual Bank stand out? </li>
		<li>User retention: Once someone finishes a tutorial, what keeps them coming back? </li>
	</ul>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>We agreed that there are a lot of challenges when it comes to building a website such as “visual bank.”  Things can become hard to moderate if posts are left unattended,
		users can become overwhelmed or get bored easily, and the website itself might not be able to uphold all the content and activity. Not only that, but it might not be able to stand out amongst
		the already established platforms such as Youtube or Behance. If the website isn’t good enough to keep users, what can help them come back to this platform and not a competitor. Using the black hat can help see the 
		downside of creating such a largescale website, with the idea of having so much content, it can create a lot of problems for users. </p>
		<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
			<p>This is the logical positive. Why something will work and why it will offer benefits. It can be used in looking forward to the results of some proposed action but it can 
			also be used to find something of value in what has already happened. </p>
		<h3>Key Points</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A centralized space across all Adobe tools — most platforms focus on just one or two. </li>
		<li>Community-driven learning — people love learning from peers, not just pros. </li>
		<li>A gallery of work inspires new ideas, like a living portfolio for the whole community. </li>
		<li>Space for “hidden tricks” and advanced tips will be valuable even for experienced users. </li>
		<li>If done well, it could even become a go-to resource in art schools or design programs. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>Although the black hat made some good points, 
		the yellow hat helped bring out the positives of the concept. Since this platform is so big, 
		it helps include smaller communities in the creative field, and not just photoshop. 
		Communities, whether big or small, can commune and create a safe environment to learn from each other 
		and share the many different ideas they have. Who knows, if everything is done and organized well it could become
		resources amongst the workforce or even schools. With the help of the yellow hat, it made the idea so much more positive and enlightening.</p>
		<h2>Green Hat</h2>
			<p>This is the hat of creativity, alternatives, proposals, what is interesting, provocations and changes.</p>
		<h3>Key Points</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Creative Missions or Challenges: Weekly prompts or remix challenges to spark creativity. </li>
		<li>"Skill Trees": Visual roadmaps for mastering each Adobe tool — beginner to pro. </li>
		<li>Achievement Badges or gamification — reward users for uploading, completing tutorials, giving feedback. </li>
		<li>Personal “Studios”: Let users curate their own learning playlists and showcase creations. </li>
		<li>Live workshops or streams </li>
		<li>Collab Spaces: People can co-create and share layered PSDs, project files, etc. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>As I discussed as the green hat, we realized a lot more ideas that can grow from “visual bank.”
		These things can include how we can fix user retention and activity with challenges, levels in advancement, achievements, etc. 
		People could also create their own lists or playlists of tutorials they want to do or even stream their own tutorial. Instead of just photos and videos, 
		people can also share their project files and such to further create connections amongst community members. While thinking as the green hat, we found ways we can further
		advance this website and create even more features to connect users. </p>
		<h2>Blue Hat</h2>
			<p>This is the overview or process control hat. It looks not at the subject itself but at the thinking about the subject. “Putting on my blue hat, I feel we should do some more 
			green hat thinking at this point.” </p>
		<h3>Key Points</h3>
	<p>Some Next Steps Include:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Build a simple prototype or wireframe. </li>
		<li>Define user journeys: New user? Tutorial uploader? Returning learner? </li>
		<li>Start curating high-quality tutorials as seed content. </li>
		<li>Develop a clear categorization/taxonomy structure (tool > level > type > feature). </li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>Looking over everything, we agreed that we had a solid idea and concept for a 
		media-sharing platform. Although it may be like some websites, “visual bank” will be the combination of ideas to
		further connect communities. Our next step is to create a frame for the website, find a way to make the website as appealing as possible to all users 
		whether it is returned or new, start finding or creating these tutorials, and develop an organized structure. With the help of thinking like the blue hat, we established the next steps 
		and the main ideas we want to focus on to start the website’s structure. </p>
	<h2>Discussion Summary</h2>
	<p>With these discussions as the 6 hats,
		I realized there is a lot more thought to put into this website than I thought.
		I realized that it was going to be a lot more difficult and challenging,
		especially to keep users active. Although that is the case, 
		I also realized how helpful it would be for creatives and people in similar fields as I am. 
		I found a lot more ideas and potential add-ons to the website to further increase community interactions and features that can help beginners. 
		In the end, my project has changed a little, but not significantly. If anything, it changes for the better with the realization of all the 
		different things that can be added to combat the pessimism of the black hat or answering the questions of the white hat.
