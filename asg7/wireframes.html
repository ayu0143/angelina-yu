  <h1>The Guide to Wireframing</h1>
  <h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software? </h2>
  <h3>Advantages:</h3>
  <p>Sketching wireframes on paper or on a hard copy is quick and easy, convenient. 
    You can do it anywhere and without any technology. Another advantage is that you can convey your thoughts better 
    without the boundaries of wireframing software. Instead of compromising your design with a template that they provide, 
    you could draw out your true intentions. While sketching on paper, it is also easier to focus on the structure of the 
    wireframe versus the design. With software, adding designs can easily distract from the main task of structure, 
    making it simple and easy in writing. 
 </p>
  <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
  <p>When it comes to the disadvantages of sketching out wireframes, there are a lot. 
    Sketching is very messy and is hard to edit, not to mention it can also be drawn ugly to where it can be illegible.
    It can also be hard to have consistency throughout a sketch, and it would be hard to show the intentions of different fonts,
    animations, certain pictures, etc. One of the main points of wireframing is to easily share the idea and structure with others.
    With a hard copy, it would be difficult to share and collaborate with other people. Not to mention,
    it would have to be that one copy that is edited and having access to that can be proven difficult.

  <h2>Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why. </h2>
  <p>I believe wireframing software would be the best for my project because of the many layers 
    and links that would organize my website. It would easily make its structure and navigation 
    much easier to understand for the future. I would consider making the graphic design choice, 
    but I want to focus more on organizational features versus visual design. 
    I believe the best style within wireframing software is high-infidelity interactions. 
    This is because my website plans on having a lot of features and links for the user to click on. 
    To have a general idea on how to structure these buttons to send them to specific pages, high-infidelity interactions
    would be the best style as an outline.

	  It would include the content, their title, username, desciption, and an area of comments if they allow it.
	  It would also recommend other content similar on one row and other content that the artist has created on another.
