	<h2>Decision</h2>
	<h3>Discussion</h3>
	<p>Before my classmate and I decided to talk about the different names, I briefly explained the concept of the website "Visual Bank".
		They liked the idea and wanted to hear the breakdown of the names, we then briefly discussed which of the 3 we liked the most. 
		We ended up both liking the first one, the second one we agreed was kind of plain, and the last one could be taken the wrong way.
	</p>
	<h3>Final Choice</h3>
	<p>We concluded on the first one. I explained the idea of the name and how my last name is Yu, so "visual" and "vizyu" are kind of play on words. 
		Then bank is the concept of the website, the storage of information for people to use. 
		We both liked the creativity of the name, and how using ".net" is a good way to show it's also a form of social media.</p>
