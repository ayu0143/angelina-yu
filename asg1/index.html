	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>3 Things I Learned from the Reading Assignments</h2>
	  <ol>
		  <li>The web has grown a lot since it's beginning and since then it has grown standards for user interfaces.
			   The web no longer needed tables and fancy fonts, but it evolved into something more creating new technologies.</li>
		  <li>The web has been through several generations and has grown in its use to the people. 
			   The  internet has grown significantly in its applications, services, and it is only going to continue to evolve as time goes on.</li>
		  <li>It is okay to keep learning and make silly mistakes, but design thoughtfully and feel free to share your finds with others. 
			   A good web design is functional, artsy, and its interface is designed thoughtfully and intentionally.</li>
	  </ol>
	<h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	<p>As someone that struggles to find inspiration for projects and maybe a specific design or style. 
		I would want to create a website where I could share helpful graphic designers in the industry that create tutorials. 
		<br> They would be sorted in ranges of skill for beginners to professionals, and just have overall inspiration or fun projects to do. 
		This can also include helpful links to websites where designers can practice their skills or different platforms to create interesting kinds of media.</p>
