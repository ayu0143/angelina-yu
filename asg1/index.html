	<h2>3 Things I Learned from the Reading Assignments</h2>
	  <ol>
		  <li>The web has grown a lot since it's beginning and since then it has grown standards for user interfaces.
			   The web no longer needed tables and fancy fonts, but it evolved into something more creating new technologies. 
			   <br> It is okay to keep learning and make silly mistakes, but design thoughtfully and feel free to share your finds with others.</li>
		  <li>The web has been through several generations and has grown in its use to the people. 
			   The  internet has grown significantly in its applications, services, and it is only going to continue to evolve as time goes on.</li>
