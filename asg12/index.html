	<p>Majority of my favorite movies are animations, with deep adventurous plots. Some of the animations and live actions are directed by Tim Burton, whom has a famous
	style and concept in his movies. Some others are just old animated fantasy-based Disney movies, and others are just comedies.
	When it comes to my favorite movies, I have to be able to rewatch them time to time without getting sick of them. 
	One day, I'll just suddenly feel the need to watch one of the movies listed below and I never find myself dissapointed.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
	 <div class="alice">
          <img src="images/alice.png">
          <h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2>
          <p>One of my favorite renditions of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland is Tim Burton's live action starring Mia Wasikowska as Alive, Johnny Depp as the 
		  Mad Hatter, Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. If unfamiliar with Alice in Wonderland, it's about a girl who
		  falls down a rabbit hole and into a world called Wonderland. She fights to save Wonderland from the evil Red Queen with the help of her friends.</p>

	 <div class="anastasia">
          <img src="images/anastasia.jpg">
          <h2>Anastasia</h2>
          <p>Anastasia is an animated musical, based on the speculations of the lost Romanov Anastasia. It features an orphan girl who lost her memories
		  and throughout the movie regains them to finally remember who she is and where she's from. There's romance, comedy, and adventure that makes it so enjoyable.</p>
	 </div>
	<div class="atlantis">
          <img src="images/atlantis.jpg">
          <h2>The Lost City of Atlantis</h2>
          <p>This animated movie is about an adventure about finding the Lost City of Atlantis. There's betrayal, romance, and friendship throughout this movie.
		  It gives it drama and excitment with the search for the lost city, and it never gets boring.</p>
	 </div>
	<div class="coraline">
          <img src="images/coraline.webp">
          <h2>Coraline</h2>
          <p>Coraline is a stop-motion animated film directed by Henry Selick. It is made for children, but is well known for even creeping out adults.
		  It's based off of Neil Gaiman's fantasy horror written for children. Selick does a great job creating personalities to characters, and
		  the wonderful thrill to see Coraline defeat her enemies.</p>
	 </div>
		<div class="corpse">
          <img src="images/corpse.webp">
          <h2>Corpse Bride</h2>
          <p>This film is a stop-motion animated film directed by Tim Burton. It follows the main character Victor Van Dort who finds himself in
		  an arranged marriage. While practicing his vows in the forest, he accidentally finds himself eloping with a corpse bride. The premise of the movie

	 </div>
	<div class="cruella">
          <img src="images/cruella.jpeg">
          <h2>Cruella</h2>
          <p>Cruella is a reimagined live action of 101 Dalmations, featuring the backstory of the main villian Cruella DeVille.
		  The main premise of this movie is Cruella's double personality, and her climb to the top with fashion and trickery. 
		  It is a well-made live action that is fun and attention-drawing, espcially if you have an eye for fashion.</p>
	 </div>
		<div class="james">
          <img src="images/james.jpg">
          <h2>James and the Giant Peach</h2>
          <p>This film is a mixture of live action and stop-motion animation, also animated by Tim Burton. The themes
		  are less dark than his other films, but still find the viewer at the edge of their seat at times. It's an interesting concept
		  where this orphan boy names James finds himself surrounded by life-sized bugs that help him get to the New York Empire State Building via a flying peach.</p>
	 </div>
	<div class="lego">
          <img src="images/lego.jpg">
          <h2>The Lego Movie</h2>
          <p>I like a lot of stop-motion films, but the way they created The Lego Movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It's the way that
		  they can express so many emotions with tiny lego people is beautiful. This movie is about this regular and average guy, who ends up being the most
		  important person in the story. In this world, there are people who follow the intructions, and people who create whatever they want. 
		  Someone is trying to force everybody into following the directions, but the main character helps prevent that.</p>
	 </div>
		<div class="scissors">
          <img src="images/scissorhands.webp">
          <h2>Edward Scissorhands</h2>
          <p>This movie is a live action movie, starring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder in a tragic tale of a man with scissors for hands.
		  He creates drama for a boring suburban neighborhood, as he tries to blend in with regular people. 
			There are themes of acceptance, along with love and comedy.</p>
	 </div>
		<div class="tangled">
          <img src="images/tangled.jpg">
          <h2>Tangled</h2>
          <p>This movie is my favorite Disney Princess movie. Tangled is about the princess Rapunzel who was born with magical powers that
		  can heal people with her long and luscious hair. Since her hair dies when it's cut, she grows it out her entire life and goes through
		  an adventure when she finally leaves her tall tower hidden away.</p>
	 </div>
		<div class="treasure">
          <img src="images/treasure.webp">
          <h2>Treasure Planet</h2>
          <p>Another one of my favorite old Disney movies. Treasure Planet is a movie about a boy and his single mother who end up wound
		  up in an adventure to find an old pirate's long lost treasure. Not only is it treasure, but it practically covers an entire planet with it's treasures, hence it's name.
		  This planet is hidden somewhere in the galaxies, and the map the boy stumbles upon is the key to taking them there.</p>
	 </div>
		<div class="chicks">
          <img src="images/white-chicks.jpg">
          <h2>White Chicks</h2>
          <p>This movie has a lot of crude humor, and I may have watched it at a bit too young of an age, but it's golden.
		  It's about these two detectives that get assigned to babysit these two white girls and escort them to the Hamptons.
		  On the way, they get into a car crash, and the girls can no longer go to the event. So these two African Americans
		  dress up in disguises as white girls to replace them in order to find the people who have the intent to kill the sisters.</p>
