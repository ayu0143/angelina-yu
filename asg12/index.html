	<p>Majority of my favorite movies are animations, with deep adventurous plots. Some of the animations and live actions are directed by Tim Burton, whom has a famous
	style and concept in his movies. Some others are just old animated fantasy-based Disney movies, and others are just comedies.
	When it comes to my favorite movies, I have to be able to rewatch them time to time without getting sick of them. 
	One day, I'll just suddenly feel the need to watch one of the movies listed below and I never find myself dissapointed.</p>

          <h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2>
          <p>One of my favorite renditions of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland is Tim Burton's live action starring Mia Wasikowska as Alive, Johnny Depp as the 
		  Mad Hatter, Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. If unfamiliar with Alice in Wonderland, it's about a girl who
		  falls down a rabbit hole and into a world called Wonderland. She fights to save Wonderland from the evil Red Queen with the help of her friends.</p>

          <h2>Anastasia</h2>
          <p>Anastasia is an animated musical, based on the speculations of the lost Romanov Anastasia. It features an orphan girl who lost her memories
		  and throughout the movie regains them to finally remember who she is and where she's from. There's romance, comedy, and adventure that makes it so enjoyable.</p>
