	<p>Majority of my favorite movies are animations, with deep adventurous plots. Some of the animations and live actions are directed by Tim Burton, whom has a famous
	style and concept in his movies. Some others are just old animated fantasy-based Disney movies, and others are just comedies.
	When it comes to my favorite movies, I have to be able to rewatch them time to time without getting sick of them. 
	One day, I'll just suddenly feel the need to watch one of the movies listed below and I never find myself dissapointed.</p>

<div class="main">

          <h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2>
          <p>One of my favorite renditions of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland is Tim Burton's live action starring Mia Wasikowska as Alive, Johnny Depp as the 
		  Mad Hatter, Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. If unfamiliar with Alice in Wonderland, it's about a girl who
		  falls down a rabbit hole and into a world called Wonderland. She fights to save Wonderland from the evil Red Queen with the help of her friends.</p>

          <h2>Anastasia</h2>
          <p>Anastasia is an animated musical, based on the speculations of the lost Romanov Anastasia. It features an orphan girl who lost her memories
		  and throughout the movie regains them to finally remember who she is and where she's from. There's romance, comedy, and adventure that makes it so enjoyable.</p>

	<div class="atlantis">
          <img src="images/atlantis.jpg">
          <h2>The Lost City of Atlantis</h2>
          <p>This animated movie is about an adventure about finding the Lost City of Atlantis. There's betrayal, romance, and friendship throughout this movie.
		  It gives it drama and excitment with the search for the lost city, and it never gets boring.</p>

	<div class="coraline">
          <img src="images/coraline.webp">
          <h2>Coraline</h2>
          <p>Coraline is a stop-motion animated film directed by Henry Selick. It is made for children, but is well known for even creeping out adults.
		  It's based off of Neil Gaiman's fantasy horror written for children. Selick does a great job creating personalities to characters, and
		  the wonderful thrill to see Coraline defeat her enemies.</p>
	 </div>
		<div class="corpse">
          <img src="images/corpse.webp">
          <h2>Corpse Bride</h2>
          <p>This film is a stop-motion animated film directed by Tim Burton. It follows the main character Victor Van Dort who finds himself in
		  an arranged marriage. While practicing his vows in the forest, he accidentally finds himself eloping with a corpse bride. The premise of the movie
		  is finding a way to solve Victor's obstacles in an thrilling ride.</p>

	<div class="cruella">
          <img src="images/cruella.jpeg">
          <h2>Cruella</h2>
          <p>Cruella is a reimagined live action of 101 Dalmations, featuring the backstory of the main villian Cruella DeVille.
		  The main premise of this movie is Cruella's double personality, and her climb to the top with fashion and trickery. 
		  It is a well-made live action that is fun and attention-drawing, espcially if you have an eye for fashion.</p>

		<div class="james">
          <img src="images/james.jpg">
          <h2>James and the Giant Peach</h2>
          <p>This film is a mixture of live action and stop-motion animation, also animated by Tim Burton. The themes
		  are less dark than his other films, but still find the viewer at the edge of their seat at times. It's an interesting concept
		  where this orphan boy names James finds himself surrounded by life-sized bugs that help him get to the New York Empire State Building via a flying peach.</p>
