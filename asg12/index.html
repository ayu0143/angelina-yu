	<p>Majority of my favorite movies are animations, with deep adventurous plots. Some of the animations and live actions are directed by Tim Burton, whom has a famous
	style and concept in his movies. Some others are just old animated fantasy-based Disney movies, and others are just comedies.
	When it comes to my favorite movies, I have to be able to rewatch them time to time without getting sick of them. 
	One day, I'll just suddenly feel the need to watch one of the movies listed below and I never find myself dissapointed.</p>
