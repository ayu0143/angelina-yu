<h2>Why They Are My Favorite</h2>
	<p>The reason why they are my favorite is because of the feeling of comfort they often bring to their fans. They make me feel like I belong somewhere and that I will always find comfort in 
	their music. Their music is also just really good, and they have such a large variety of music that can easily match any of my moods. 
	Some of their music is really hype, some others are playful and fun, while others can be sad and somber. I agree that their sound isn't for everyone, 
	but their messages and music reside in me very deeply.</p>
