	<h2>Readings and Questions</h2>
		<h3>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of 
		number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious). </h3>
		<a href="https://tmhpr.com/">Link To Website</a>
		<p>In this adoption site, below the “About Us” section there’s four boxes with photos that have the subheadings: Adopt, Volunteer, Foster, Donate. 
		One would think that the text would be the links at first glance, but it is the photos that send you to the specific part of the website. </p>
		<h3>From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: 
		How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation. </h3>
		<p>Framing your project in a story format can help you refine your ideas because of the way it helps your audience guide through your project, 
		engage in it, and remember it in the best way possible. By using storytelling, it enhances your project and gives it humanity, a better overall experience, and a better understanding. 
		Like Dorelle Rabinowitz states,” You can get designers, engineers, product managers, strategists and execs jazzed about a proposed feature because of a story, and it can be extremely fulfilling.” 
		It is important to get people excited about your project, or they’ll forget it. Christian Saylor said, “If you’re telling the right story to the wrong audience, or even telling the right story the wrong way, 
		then your business or product will ultimately fade away.” As you can see, it is important to frame your project in a story format so that it’s better for your audience and your staple in their lives. </p>
		<h3>From Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography: What are different ways to establish hierarchy 
		(or emphasis) in typography design? Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy. </h3>
		<p>Some ways to establish a hierarchy or emphasis using typography design is by playing with the size of the text, 
		the font, the color, or the placement of the texts. </p>

	<h2>Creative Brief</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Problem</th>
				<td>A problem that I want to solve as a graphic designer is that I want to fix the struggle to find inspiration or a certain way to create something on Adobe Photoshop. 
					I find myself needing a certain aid that I can’t find anywhere on the internet without searching endlessly. With this project, I want to expand on the accessibilty 
					of information when it comes to designing and organizing it for my audience to find what they need easily. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Audience</th>
				<td>My audience are females or males in their mid-teens to mid-twenties that are majority of beginner designers, experienced designers who are older and in need inspiration 
					for new projects or interested in learning current trends, or people who are just looking to learn new skills for fun.  </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Competition</th>
				<td>The biggest competition would probably be professional teaching websites that have professional teachers with courses that are often required to be paid for.
					They offer organized teachings, but people shouldn’t pay for something they might already know or something so simple that it could have been free.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Key Messages</th>
				<td>Designers often don’t know where to start on their projects, tasks, or assignments. With a website such as this one,
					it would be easier for people to reach the kind of information they want to obtain.
