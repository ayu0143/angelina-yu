<h1>Career Webpage</h1>
  <p>I believe my ideal job based on my interest and current/ future abilities is being a graphic designer.  Preferably a remote one.
    Ever since middle school, I have always enjoyed creating graphics with different assets to create a fully composed piece of art. 
    Although, I don’t find myself to be the best artist, I believe in my abilities to comprise or create full organized compositions. 
    I have also found myself creating unique graphics for things related to my small business. </p>

    <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
	  <a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=6ec6eb969b3328fb&from=shareddesktop_copy">Meow Wolf Application Page</a>
    <p>Meow Wolf is a brand and aesthetic that I would love to be a part of. 
		The whimsiness and the childlike wonder would be a dream to design for. Seeing their company grow from a museum in New Mexico,
		to opening several other locations. I would love to be a part of their growing team. Their concepts are so colorful, 
		and I could only imagine the type of things I would design for them. Whether it be merch, advertisements, 
		or concepts for new showings. I want to be a part of it. </p>

	  <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
	  <a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=7ff9cff3c60e12a8&from=shareddesktop_copy">Fengcha Application Page</a>
    <p>As someone that used to work at a Fengcha, it would be so cool to be able to design something that everybody
		in the company would see. Not only within the company, but the designs that I made would be shown to the eyes of every consumer
		or possible customer. The idea to create graphics for a company I’m so familiar with would be a dream, and a treat for my younger self. 
		The pay may not be top tier, but I would not mind having this job under my belt. </p>

    <h3>Digital Designer</h3>

    <p>Although Under Armour is not an ideal company to work for, I’m familiar with it. It is a brand that shows up often and is very sporty.
		I am personally not a very sporty type, but I would not mind working for this modern company.
		I also recognize it from the several sponsorships they have given my school teams growing up, and it would be cool to work for them. 
		My aunt also wears it a lot, so if I told her that I was working for them, she would be thrilled. </p>
