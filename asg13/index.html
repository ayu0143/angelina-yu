<h1>Career Webpage</h1>
  <p>I believe my ideal job based on my interest and current/ future abilities is being a graphic designer.  Preferably a remote one.
    Ever since middle cshool, I have always enjoyed creating graphics with different assets to create a fully composed piece of art. 
    Although, I don’t find myself to be the best artist, I believe in my abilities to comprise or create full organized compositions. 
    I have also found myself creating unique graphics for things related to my small business. </p>
