	<h1>Dinner Invitation</h1>
	<h3>Guest 1</h3>
	<img src="images/oshawatt.jfif">
	<p>I would invite Oshawatt because of his funny persoanlity. 
	He is known for being playful and overdramatic, and that might make dinner more interesting.
	Not only that, but he would get along with the other two guests, and overall just have a good time.</p>
	<h3>Guest 2</h3>
	<img src="images/piplup.jfif">\
	<p>Piplup is known for being sassy and also a little dramatic. He is fun, but cute, and a good addition to have for a fun meal. 
	Piplup and Oshawatt are known to play fight and tease each other, so things would get loud and not very boring.</p>
	<h3>Guest 3</h3>
	<img src="images/psyduck.png">
	<p>Psyduck is also very dramatic, but playful and understanding. He is unfortunately known for easily getting headaches and getting irritated easily. 
	With all three of these guests, it would be funny to see the different dynamics that would come along with the trio. </p>
