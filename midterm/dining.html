	<h1>Dining</h1>
		<p>While you visit Hogwarts, there are several different places where you can dine and try the delicious delicacies of a wizard! </p>
	<h2>Hagrid's Hut</h2>
		<p>Placed on the edge of the Forbidden Forest with a warm, cozy, and welcoming atmosphere.
			Hagrid’s Hut is filled with the smell of a burning fireplace and earthy herbs. 
			The meals Hagrid serves are hearty and often oversized portions of rock cakes, sizzling sausages, 
			and thick stews to match his giant background. Maybe you can even catch a glimpse of one of Hagrid’s
			mystical friends while in deep conversation with him. Even though you may come for a meal, 
			you also come for an experience that will last a wizardly lifetime.  </p>

	<h2>The Great Hall</h2>
		<p>Dining in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, you'd be swept into a magical feast unlike anything you've ever experienced. 
			The enchanted ceiling will make you feel like you’re in a different world, casting a dreamy glow with candlelit tables.
			Platters of roast meats, golden Yorkshire puddings, buttery vegetables, and steaming pies would be widely available 
			to every guest. The chatter within the hall and the atmosphere makes you feel like you’re just another student. 
			Every bite tastes like magic, and you’d leave not just full, but dazzled. </p>

	<h2>The Three Broomsticks</h2>
		<p>Dining at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade would be a comforting and witchy experience. 
			The restaurant's wooden interior, crackling fireplace, and enchanted lanterns create a welcoming atmosphere. 
			Guests can sip on frothy Butterbeer while enjoying hearty dishes like shepherd’s pie or roast beef. 
			It’s the perfect spot to relax, share stories, and soak in the charm of the wizarding world. 
			The most popular time of year to visit is during the winter, when things are especially cheery and joyful. </p>
