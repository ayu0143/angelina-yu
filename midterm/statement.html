	<h1>Design Statement</h1>
	<p>
		Harry Potter is one of my favorite movie series and franchises so I thought it would be fun to create a vacation getaway 
		website based on Hogwarts. It seems to be a fun location with plenty of things to do, another reason why I chose it. 
		As for the visual design, I wanted to make it seem like an actual destination website with assets that are still 
		connected to the concept of the series. It has a very rustic and somewhat dark feel to match the themes of the movies. 
	<br>
		For the typeface selection, I made sure to choose somewhat gothic-looking fonts that are thick and eye-catching 
		for the display fonts. As for the sans-serif fonts, I wanted something that matched the headings well, but still 
		legible for audiences to read with ease. I also decided for a left alignment for the texts to ensure clear readability
		and to further enhance the attraction towards the photos on the website. For the size of the fonts, 
		I decided to stick with the type scale generator to help with the flow of the sizes. 
	<br>
		The color palette for the website is very heavily inspired by the 4 houses that are in Harry Potter. 
		These houses included Gryffindor (red), Slytherin (green, Ravenclaw (blue), and Hufflepuff (yellow.) 
		There are also complimentary colors of those main 4, often found on student’s robes or other accessories such as: 
		different shades of brown, gold, gray, etc. For the images I wanted to make sure they seemed possibly appealing to 
		the audience as if they wanted to be there themselves. This included scenery pictures, or especially lively ones that
		engaged the audience.  
	<br>
		Lastly for the buttons, I wanted to make sure that they were easy to find or spot. 
		I made them a different color that stood out on the backgrounds of red, green, blue, and yellow. 
		Since I was aiming for a more rustic look and feel, I decided to stick to a lot of browns as complimentary colors which worked out in the end. 
		I also wanted the buttons to seem appealing and important, so I made sure to make them the same font as the headings and centered them.
