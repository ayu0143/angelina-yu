    <h3>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h3>
      <p>Structured content organizes information to make it more legible for the algorithm. They  are more legible than semantic HTML. Semantic HTML describes and 
      communicates the relationship of the information. </p>
    <h3>How do they work together? </h3>
      <p>Semantic HTML creates the information and the foundation to where the web can understand structured content. With the foundation that semantic HTML provides, 
      structed content formats and organizes it to readable content. </p>
    <h3>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages? </h3>
      <p>It is important to have both structured content and semantic HTML because it creates website accessbility because it would be difficult for the web to work with one without the other.
