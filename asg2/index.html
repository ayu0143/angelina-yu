    <h3>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h3>
      <p>Structured content organizes information to make it more legible for the algorithm. They  are more legible than semantic HTML. Semantic HTML describes and 
      communicates the relationship of the information. </p>
    <h3>How do they work together? </h3>
      <p>Semantic HTML creates the information and the foundation to where the web can understand structured content. With the foundation that semantic HTML provides, 
      structed content formats and organizes it to readable content. </p>
    <h3>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages? </h3>
      <p>It is important to have both structured content and semantic HTML because it creates website accessbility because it would be difficult for the web to work with one without the other. 
      Semantic creates meaningful content for the foundation of webpages and structured organizes that content. </p>

    <h3>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why? </h3>
      <p>I believe being “Deceptively Non-Committal,” would work the best for me because of my lack of motivation. The hardest part of an assignement or art is starting the project. 
        Based on Denise Jaobs article, I can help that by slowly getting ready for it and convincing myself that I’m not actually doing it.  </p>
    <h3>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you? </h3>
      <p>According to the article hyperbolic discounting is “the tendency to get more rational when you are forced to wait.” It’s practically a fancy way to say procrastinating makes it easier 
        to ignore the things you don’t want to do, and you end up running out of time because you keep thinking of the future.  The way I can conteract this hyperbolic discounting is by focusing 
        on the “now me” versus the “future me” because I don’t know how the “future me” will react to the work given by the previous “now me.” </p>
    <h3>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work? </h3>
      <p>As the creator and publisher of my own work, I get to constitute what I get to publish and how it’s structured. As a beginner I can't do much due to the skills that I lack, 
        but I can decide how I want my users to navigate my website and choose how my content travels across the internet. Whether it is the way it looks, the content it holds, 
        or the links that it has. I get to decide all of that. </p>
