<h2>Early Life</h2>
  <p>Timothy Walter Burton was born on August 25, 1958, in Burbank, California, the son of Jean Burton (n√©e Erickson), 
    who in the 1980s was the owner of a cat-themed gift shop, and William "Bill" Burton, a former minor league baseball player, 
    who worked for many years for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department. The baseball field at Olive Recreation Center in Burbank, 
    California is named for Bill Burton.</p>
<h2>The Start of His Career</h2>
  <p>As a preteen, Burton made short films in his backyard at 2101 North Evergreen Street, using crude stop motion animation techniques or shooting on 8 mm film without sound 
    (one of his oldest known juvenile films is The Island of Doctor Agor, adapted from the H. G. Wells novel The Island of Doctor Moreau, which he made when he was 13 years old).
    Stalk of the Celery Monster attracted the attention of Walt Disney Productions, who offered Burton an animator's apprenticeship at its animation division.[14] He worked as an animator, 
    storyboard artist, graphic designer, art director, and concept artist on films such as The Fox and the Hound (1981), Tron (1982), and The Black Cauldron (1985). 
    His concept art never made it into the finished films.</p>
